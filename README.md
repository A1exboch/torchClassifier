Classification Model Mathematics
================================
This repository explains the math behind Classification Models. 
Chat-GPT was used to generate a Classification Model and its it's associated mathematics. 
In this repository, we strive to gain a deeper undestanding of how Classification models work, 
as well how one would implement such a model in Pytorch.

The creator of this repository has used Chat-GPT to write mathematics and code for this project. 
He takes no credit for anything done in it.
This repository above all else serves as a learning tool and an exercise in teaching.

### Problem Definition
In this project, we want to imput an image that contains a number 1-10 and "classify" that image.

### Forward Pass

The inputs we are training on are images. The images in the MNIST dataset are 28x28 pixels. We input into the model 

$\textbf{x} = $

### Predictions

Here is an example of images and the prediction that the model made with them.

Here is an example of the model being trained on 50 Epochs with 50 total predictions
