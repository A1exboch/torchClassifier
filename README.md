### Classification Model Mathematics
This repository explains the math behind Classification Models. 
Chat-GPT was used to generate a Classification Model and its it's associated mathematics. 
With the information provided, we strive to gain a deeper undestanding of how Classification models work, 
as well how one would implement such a model in Pytorch.
Above all else, this repository serves as a learning tool for it's creator.

### Problem Definition
In this project, we want to imput an image that contains a number 1-10 and "classify" that image. 
Here is an example of images and the prediction that the model made with them.
