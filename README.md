Classification Model Mathematics
================================
This repository explains the math behind Classification Models. 
Chat-GPT was used to generate a Classification Model and its it's associated mathematics. 
In this repository, we strive to gain a deeper undestanding of how Classification models work, 
as well how one would implement such a model in Pytorch.

The creator of this repository has used Chat-GPT to write mathematics and code for this project. 
He takes no credit for anything done in it.
This repository above all else serves as a learning tool and an exercise in teaching.

### Problem Definition
In this project, we want to imput an image that contains a number 1-10 and "classify" that image. 
Here is an example of images and the prediction that the model made with them.
